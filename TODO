  * [ 33] [TODO] who should be able to arrive here and how?

app/controllers/application_controller.rb:
  * [ 13] [FIXME] should be short_name so that we get "/pdx/blah" rather than "/123/blah"

  * [ 15] [TODO] - needs to be able to handle barcodes too

app/controllers/storage_locations_controller.rb:
  * [ 36] [TODO] - the intake! method needs to be worked into this controller somehow.
  * [ 37] [TODO] - the distribute! method needs to be worked into this controller somehow

app/models/barcode_item.rb:
  * [ 25] [TODO] - this should be renamed to something more specific -- it produces a hash, not a line_item object

app/models/diaper_drive_participant.rb:
  * [ 26] [TODO] - This should be set up with a callback to cache the total so we're not hitting the DB

app/models/distribution.rb:
  * [ 29] [TODO] Should these be added to Itemizable?

app/models/donation.rb:
  * [ 70] [TODO] - Can this be simplified so that we can just pass it the donation_item_params hash?

  * [100] [TODO] - This should check for existence of the item first. Also, I think there's a to_h method in Barcode, isn't there?

app/models/inventory_item.rb:
  * [ 30] [TODO] - is there a reason for doing this instead of setting a DB default?

app/models/storage_location.rb:

  * [140] [TODO] - this is called from the AdjustmentsController, should probably be in a service, not this model
  * [172] [TODO] - this action is happening in the DistributionsController. Is this model the correct place for this method?
